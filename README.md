# Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning

This is my first machine learning project!  
I built a classifier to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

## Steps
- data exploration and preprocessing
- train/test split
- built a classification model using [Algorithm: e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.]
- evaluated model performance

## How to run
- open the Jupyter Notebook `Breast_cancer_projectML.ipynb` in Google Colab or locally.

## What I learned
- how to load and preprocess datasets
- basics of training ML models in scikit-learn
- the importance of evaluation metrics in medical datasets
