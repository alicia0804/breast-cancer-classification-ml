# Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning

This was my first machine learning project. I built a classifier to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. 
The project introduced me to the fundamentals of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a real-world medical context.


Dataset
The dataset contains various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) samples of breast masses. Each record describes cell characteristics such as radius, texture, smoothness, and compactness.
The target variable is represented as:
0 → Benign (Healthy)
1 → Malignant (Cancerous)


Project Workflow
1)Imported and explored the dataset to understand the features and their relationships.
2)Preprocessed the data by handling missing values and standardizing features.
3)Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
4)Trained a Logistic Regression model to classify tumors.
5)Evaluated the model’s performance using accuracy and other key metrics.
6)Built a simple predictive system to identify whether a new sample is benign or malignant.


Results and Learning
This project helped me understand the core steps of a machine learning workflow from loading and preprocessing data to training a predictive model and interpreting results.
It also showed me the importance of using evaluation metrics carefully, especially in medical datasets where accuracy has real implications.
